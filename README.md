# Multiple-Parallax-Images-In-Website

Using Sass can be a lot more efficient to display mutliple images using the same styling. If you are displaying images using CSS properties, 
like background-image: url(), your code can become quiet repetitive and long. If you don't want to use a server-side language, like PHP, then 
Sass is a create way to reduce code using mixins, extend, and nesting. This code show what I used in my project to reduce code and display four 
parallax images in this website.
